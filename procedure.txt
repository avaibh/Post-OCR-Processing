we r now having the probability map of the confusions from train pairs (done @ 3:22 p.m. 19 May 2017)
now we have to find the corresponding probability of the confusions of the pairs taken from top 10 edit distances
/----/
we r having a map with confusions of rAg and the other string from top 10 edit distances

we r having confusions, eg: g -> k
now we have to find the probability of the confusions

for each confusions estimated from top 10 edit distances find probability from confusion map of train pairs.

in our program all the map are of the form map <string, int>
ConfPmap1 = confusions from train pairs stored
lw_ConfPmap = map storing confusions from top 10 edit distances

On monday:
think where to we have to call the loadProb_editDistance function and how do we have to use it.....
think upon what does rohit sir mean when he said to add 1 to each frequency and I'm not sure what did he meant
work on probability and sandhi
