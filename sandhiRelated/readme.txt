maheshvaram = mahaishvaram
gives confusion "e -> ai" 30

v -> b 50

1) Use Sandhi and then find possible options:-
rAgeshwaram: say nearest word n1 has  probability Pr1

Try all sandhis: say 1st is e->ai
rAgaishwaram : say nearest word n2 has probability Pr2 (and remember in end to combine using same sandhi rule)


say second is e->ii
rAgiishwaram : say nearest word n3 has probability Pr3 (and remember in end to combine using same sandhi rule)

Compare Pr1, Pr(e -> ai)*Pr2 , Pr(e -> ii)*Pr3 to compare n1, n2 and n3 and so on...


Imagine for case ragcshwaram, what will you do to include Sandhi here? Less probable in Indian languages because vowels have different glyph shapes than consonants...

raAgeshwaram
rAageshwaram
rAAgeshwaram

2)

rag -> rama
rag does not have vowel in end whereas rama has, so when you get confusion "$e->$i" from eshwaram -> ishwaram, do not search for its frequency but search for frequency of "e -> ai"

So exact rule is delete $ from $e and substitude $ in $i with a(last vowel of nearest word in left).
Also in this case for left word, use freq of confusion "g -> m" and not "g -> ma"
